<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## ❓ | About The Project:

<image src="assets/screenshot1.png"></image>

We made sure that the project is gonna be simple and easy to read and to understand, our code was written 100% in pure TypeScript, using the popular module to make Discord bots "discord.js", and the one and only, "NodeJS"

Here's why, you should use our command handler:

- Our code is 100% free-to-use, and open-source for everyone ! 😍

- [NodeJS](https://www.nodejs.org)
- [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)
